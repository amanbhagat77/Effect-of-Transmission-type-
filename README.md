# Effect of Transmission type in cars on fuel efficiency
# Overview

This report is prepared as a part of coursework required for the Coursera Regression Model course. The
instruction for this report assigmnet state as follows:
You work for Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry. Looking at a data set of a collection
of cars, they are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon
(MPG) (outcome). They are particularly interested in the following two questions:
“Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG” “Quantify the MPG difference between automatic
and manual transmissions”
For this work we will use mtcars dataset to investigate the required the task.
